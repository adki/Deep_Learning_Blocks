# 1. Overview<a name="overview"></a>
'DLB (Deep Learning Blocks)' as a part of DPU (Deep Learning Processing
Unit) is a collection of synthesizable Verilog modules for deep learning
inference network.

DLB blocks contain followings (some are under development and more will be added):
* Convolution layer (straightforward 2D convolution)
* Pooling layer (2D max pooling)
* Fully connected layer (1D linear vector-to-matric multiplication)
* Concat layer
* Residual layer (point-to-point adder)
* move, Fill, and so on.

The blocks have following highlights:
* Fully synthesizable Verilog code
* Parameterized to be adopted wide range of usages
* Test-benches for Verilog, C/C++, and PyTorch
* FPGA verified using Future Design Systemsâ€™

### 1.1 Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>
This program requires followings.
* GNU GCC: C++ compiler
* PyTorch / Conda / Python3
* HDL simulator: Xilinx Xsim (Xilinx Vivado 2019.1 or later)
    - Xilinx Vivado 2017 or earlier version does not support SystemVerilog features that are used in this project.
    - Xilinx Vivado Webpack will be fine, which does not require license.
* FPGA implementation: Xilinx Vivado
* <a href="https://github.com/adki/cosim_bfm_library" target="_blank">HW-SW Co-Simulation Library for AMBA AXI BFM using DPI/VPI</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/github-fds/Deep_Learning_Routines" target="_blank">DLR: Deep Learning Routines</a> (v1.4 for thie project)

### 1.2 Prepare environment<a name="environment"></a>

## 5.1 Project: LeNet-5 for MNIST<a name="project_lenet5"></a>
LeNet-5 is a popular convolutional
neural network architecture for handwritten and
machine-printed character recognition.

Following picture summarizes how to use DPU for LeNet-5 inference network,
in which design flow consists of three major phases.

* Training phase: Training on PyTorch
  * It uses PyTorch framework for modeling and training the LeNet-5 to get trained weights.
* Verification phase: HW/SW co-simulation
  * It uses cosim framework for verifying functionality after preparing DPU RTL and SW.
* Inferencing phase: Running on FPGA
  * It uses CON-FMC frmework to run the model on FPGA along with SW through USB.

This project uses '32-bit floating point' data type and there is no need
to manipulate trainined weights. This project does not have 'network compiler'
that could generate C/C++/Python SW code to control DPU hardware.
